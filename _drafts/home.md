If I should ever leave home,  
Remind me to forget something behind-  
A piece of my childhood  
Plays hide and seek   
In the folds of curtains,  
That now hold traces   
Of eyes shrouded in fabric,  
Glancing at the world passing by   
On the other side.  
  
The city on my passport,   
A frantic blur  
Of unknown alleyways,   
I have long since ceased to discover.   
It will acknowledge  
One less pair of feet,   
That wandered looking for purpose   
Through its streets,   
But then found it  
Somewhere else.   
  
An empty room in the house,   
The wooden furniture,  
A jungle of memory corpses,  
That were buried in cardboard boxes   
And packed away.  
You can paint over  
The blue on the walls.  
Seal all cracks that may hide   
Traces of my past.  
Replace the pictures   
In their frames.  
And hope that pixels make moments last longer.   
  
Soon, there will be new places,   
With walls white,   
And beds never slept in,   
Cupboards that will yearn for artifacts,   
But I’ll forget something behind  
Before learning to return.  
  
Home is an umbilical cord;   
It nestles into me   
And settles into crevices of private thought.  
I’ll come back a newborn  
Then, hold me close   
And coo sleep into my ears  
For home is not a continent,  
But you.
