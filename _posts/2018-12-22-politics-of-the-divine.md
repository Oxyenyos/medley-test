<br>Tug O’ War? ‘Twixt Arabic
<br>verses, and dialectics? House
<br>of God— a pilgrimage to Mecca— a mandate?
<br>Pelting stones, and Satan— salvation?
<br>Diktats of Islam— a religion stuck 
<br>in time.
<br>Obsolete and corrugated.
<br>High-end Heaven— a promise
<br>or fishnet? Burnt into
<br>my molten flesh, this faith, a legacy—
<br>favour or fascism? Caught between 
<br>traditionalists and 
<br>reformists— A woman I am.


<br>How do I atone for my existence?


<br>With black cloak— inch tape
<br>of virtues? Or a tiara of polygamy? 
<br>Pentagons, and prayers.
<br>Farce, and fasts.
<br>Mozart, and mosques.


<br>How do I believe in a God that
<br>wants to be praised all
<br>the time?


<br>Believers and Non-believers— a
<br>dividing line, another Auschwitz?
<br>Judgement Day— trick or treat?
