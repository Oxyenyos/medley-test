It lasted for seven minutes,
<br>A hush, a bluff, a thrust, in and out
<br>It is all the rage to grope, fondle, maul.
<br>The boy was told in the strangest time,
<br>It was a service to God.
<br>A libation to the Almighty, a nine year old.
 
The moment lasted for ten seconds
<br>For the humble sheep, the shepherd was 
<br>All that they looked out for.
<br>Your sins are unforgivable, said the pastor
<br>Bend over; maybe I can pardon 
<br>The fall from Grace.
<br>Else, the depths of damnation.
 
A blind search for clemency.
<br>The velvety touch of the Ferraiolo
<br>Still gives me the chills 
<br>As I tie the rope around my throat,
<br>to meet the Holy Light and
<br>To ask him Why
<br>Did I have to hold the thurible,
<br>As he flushed me by the altar.
