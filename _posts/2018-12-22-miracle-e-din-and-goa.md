## Miracle-e-Din

<br>I’ve always been a thief-
<br>Tamarind with jumps, mangoes with pebbles,
<br>Muskmelons off docked canoes floating on _God’s own backwaters_,
<br>Secrets from deep carapace maws, and history
<br>from skins reciting the pigments of forefathers-
<br>but something that smells like the forty-year-old me,
<br>declares that I will never be a part of the bands of bigoted businessmen,
<br>nor one of the raucous hands of extortion at _Mukai Chowk_
<br>or the arson avengers of nuptial perfidies.
<br>It tells me, in an unarticulated tongue, shows me, in a wraithlike prophecy-
<br>the fate of the prosaic promenader- 
<br>halting, in the same torn clothes of the vision,
<br>which bears a striking semblance to the inscrutable authors
<br>of those so-thin chapbooks which fell right through the library-almirah-doorgaps
<br>straight into the sand-dollar-soul of a child with thievish intentions.

## Goa

<br>That place where poets go to bask in the sun
<br>that set for the moon in their metaphors,
<br>espying the _desis_ and the _firangis_ with contrasting adjectives- lewd and lucid, blasphemous and beautiful.
<br>That place which no poet ever writes about.
<br>Not an ode to the assiduous sandcastles,
<br>to the mother removing water from her I-am-a-little-teapot girl,
<br>to the twins wrapped like snakes around their father’s trunks for legs.
<br>After sunglass-slipping to nosebridge, slant glances giving to juveniles, the admirers of exotic
<br>ethics return to pen on the sapless soil knitting noose for thirsty necks, osseous children
<br>with perilous toys of ebullient trends and their pregnant mothers with no flesh,
<br>praises for old gods and satires for modern devils but nothing for _Kokum Feni Toddy_
<br>But don’t be so disheartened O’ _Vijay’s conquest_,
<br>I will write a sonnet for the half drowning beachballing kids at _Colva_ Beach,
<br>for the rebellious kiss outside _Basilica of Bom Jesus_,
<br>for the camera conscious flamingos of _Salim Ali’s_,
<br>for the Max Cady saint under _dudhsagar falls_
<br>but nonotnever for the poets reclining and engaging in their acts of poetic voyeurisms.
