“Sumana Roy’s writing brims with rare originality, avoiding the clutches of genre and refusing to adhere to any sort of thematic restrictions. She elicits fascination at the most mundane of objects, managing to explore the wondrous life of trees in one work and the complexity of human relationships in another with equal skill and deftness of language. She flits from form to form with boundless ease, reflecting her keenness for new experiences. In the last few years, Roy has published a non-fiction genre-bending exploration of the natural world and how we fit in it; a literary fiction novel taut with tension which examines a modern marriage; a uniquely structured collection of evocative poems about love, identiy and belonging; and most recently, an edited anthology of the finest literature about animals from the subcontinent. Needless to say, Roy tries her hand at many things and enriches whatever she deems fit.”

### You've mentioned in various interviews how being from Siliguri and its non-recognition in your childhood impacted you. Do you think that was one of the driving forces behind your desire to live in tree time after getting tired of speed, and simply focus on what you want to convey to the world?

One can never be sure why we come to be who we are and also how we come to be these people. I mean – my 18-year-old self wouldn’t be able to recognise the person I am today. My present self would be a stranger to all the other selves I’ve inhabited before. The Siliguri I grew up in is not the Siliguri I live in either – they are, like my selves, unrecognisable to each other. I cannot say – at least not now, for it’s far too close in time to be conscious of these things – whether my desire to become a tree and live to tree time came to me from living in a place like Siliguri. I am tired of the speed of our lives, of travel, real and virtual, how emails demand immediate replies, how almost every task moves to the knell of that atrocious word ‘deadline’. I think – though again, I can’t be sure – my desire to become a tree is a spiritual desire, and it might have been triggered as much by the physical world as my own emotional life. 

### Recent years have seen an explosion of eco-literature, be it fiction or non-fiction. Proulx’s _Barkskins_, Wohlleben’s _The Hidden Life of Trees_, and Powers’ _The Overstory_ immediately come to mind. What led to your initial decision to write about trees and devise a whole new outlook on human-flora interaction?

I read _The Hidden Life of Trees_ last year, I think, a couple of years after the publication of _How I Became a Tree_. It wasn’t a conscious decision at all – I like books to reach me by accident. I have managed to avoid the corporatisation of my reading habit, about bestselling lists and prize-nominated books turning into must-reads, a strange phrase that is the bibliographic equivalent of keeping up with the Joneses. I haven’t read the other two books you mention, though I’ve ordered a copy of _The Overstory_. What brought me to plant life were not other books but life itself. It was the desire to escape from the emotional economy of human life, groping for a way of being that was seemingly outside the code of reciprocity. It was an emotional need that later turned into an intellectual quest – to look for people like myself, who’d exhibited the desire to become a tree.
