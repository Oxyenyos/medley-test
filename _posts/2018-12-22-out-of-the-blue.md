Red has grown tired now,
of the exhausting symbolism,
crushed by the burden
of representing love and blood,
of inducing blissfulness in a loving heart,
or inciting self-harm in a broken one,
of being present on first dates,
and in gory thoughts that permeate
even the soul, for hate
leaves nothing to chance.
 
Red wants to quit, terms non-negotiable,
will continue to represent blood, nature’s label,
but will not stand for Love
and then be expected to
lend its hue
to danger too, even though
they normally go
hand in hand,
and I don’t understand
this hue and cry, for ultimately
everything is black and white.
