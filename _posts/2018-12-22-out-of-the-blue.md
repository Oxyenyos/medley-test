<br>Red has grown tired now,
<br>of the exhausting symbolism,
<br>crushed by the burden
<br>of representing love and blood,
<br>of inducing blissfulness in a loving heart,
<br>or inciting self-harm in a broken one,
<br>of being present on first dates,
<br>and in gory thoughts that permeate
<br>even the soul, for hate
<br>leaves nothing to chance.
 
Red wants to quit, terms non-negotiable,
<br>will continue to represent blood, nature’s label,
<br>but will not stand for Love
<br>and then be expected to
<br>lend its hue
<br>to danger too, even though
<br>they normally go
<br>hand in hand,
<br>and I don’t understand
<br>this hue and cry, for ultimately
<br>everything is black and white.
