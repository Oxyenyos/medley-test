### 1.
The stones arranged like a staircase that once made 
<br>Pocket size waterfalls along the stream course
<br>Now turned into bricks you call house
<br>So when you bring a pebble from the nearest river as souvenir
<br>You bring a child to his family funeral ground

### 2.
The Bible and Science lied to us
<br>Because the sunlight
<br>Doesn't reach the place where I come from 
<br>I've lived my entire life in a glass bottle
<br>Searching for its neck
<br>Hoping to see the sun at the tunnel's end
<br>But on this planet, they call me a rolling stone
<br>Because someone's always shaking my world

### 3.
You don't know how many trees I have cut
<br>To build a ladder 
<br>So it can help me climb

Out of the bottle
<br>But the ladder won't take my weight
<br>And now the forest hates me too

### 4.
According to the World Health Organization
<br>350 million people worldwide suffer from depression
<br>And the remaining 7 billion people are blind
<br>On days depression goes out for a walk
<br>I don't blame them
<br>Depression is not as fatal as common cold
<br>And running nose will always be a better symptom of any disease
<br>Than anxiety attack at 2 AM

### 5.
You told me you'd stay
<br>If I gave you the key to my closet
<br>But you stole my skeletons and left
<br>And suddenly everyone wants
<br>A piece of boneless meat for dinner

### 6.
If it hasn't rained for years
<br>And the villagers decide
<br>A lamb must be sacrificed
<br>To please the stones in the temple
<br>They all look at me
<br>Like church priests preying on young boys 
 
### 7.
You took the last seed of my skin
<br>I was saving to grow next monsoon
<br>Hoping my new body grows a heart
<br>Heart that doesn't have a hole
<br>Doesn't need a surgery I cannot afford
<br>You were mine 
<br>Field and I sleep walked 

### 8.
I will make a bad astronaut  
<br>Who'd tell his co-workers he's going out
<br>To repair the solar panels but instead
<br>Detaches himself in space
<br>Because I have no one to come back for

### 9.<br>
My permanent address is the state of sleep
<br>I take liver medicines for dinner
<br>On Tuesdays, I collect my doctors' prescriptions
<br>And put them up on a wall
<br>So one day everyone can see
<br>Science cannot save us all

### 10.
A stone once called me stone hearted
<br>I told him 
<br>A rolling stone gathers no moss
