I went as far as ships could take,

To find the heart of sea

And I came back with half a heart,

To the sea inside of me.

<br><br>It roared. I soared on Memory's wing,

To the day the cold wind blew,

As I, this old enraptured thing,

Soaked in sorrows new.

<br><br>The golden sand once bought me shells,

And in the autumn, oysters tell

\'Gold were leaves, but golden still

Were days in Calcium's rounded frills.'

<br><br>Gone were days of moon-beamed baths,

Of sand on lands of mine,

I stood lone and watched aghast,

The comet that was Time.

<br><br>I still could skim and I could sail,

Let choppy waters be,

As long as dreams could drown me

And slumber be my sea.
