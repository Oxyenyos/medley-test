<br>The storm brews afar in the sea
<br>We can’t run and we know it
<br>You're worried, or so you say
<br>And look into my eyes searching for answers
<br>I am no library — I illustrate no dances
<br>That would sooth the wind god
<br>Or potions that can make you fly
<br>So we would not have to breathe
<br>The dust of our ruined house
<br>No, I have no method to save our cattle
<br>The shepherd dogs all ran away
<br>They know when to abandon a lost cause
<br>Nor is there an oracle, or a wise neighbour lady
<br>No champion from a prophesy
<br>To come and save us 
<br>With art, tricks or bravery
<br>You look at me again, this time
<br>With cold understanding in your eyes
<br>There is no running
<br>The winds will take our home
<br>The water will take our cattle
<br>And in that fluidic graveyard
<br>Our bodies will lie neck deep
<br>But as long as you want to draw breath
<br>After the storm has come and gone
<br>I will laugh in the face of death
<br>And spit at the feet of the wind god.
