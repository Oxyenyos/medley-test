No, my nightmares don't revolve around ghosts and spirits.  
I wish they would;  
I wish they were too unreal to  
Terrify me.

  
But instead, when I close my eyes,  
I see a little girl is pinched in her arse,

The full moon weeps a song of her cries,  
Her own family gives the wolves a pass.

  
I see the monstrous hands of an old lady  
Who always lurk on the pavements forbidden.  
They grab my feet, sudden and steady,  
For a penny or two. Herstory remains hidden.

  
I see fire in my eyes and flickering flames  
As a Shadow chases me from behind.

My dress is his armor, shrouding his shame.

His cold fingers turn my blaze blind.

I see my mother sabotaged by lies:  
The kitchen cabinet safes her cries.

I see _Saraswati_ bleed ink in the battlefield,  
She carves her own skin against the night's shield.

  
I see _kajal_ smudged like the pyre's ashes.

Veiled under the _dupatta_, the doppelganger smiles.  
Painted across her canvas are carmine slashes,

Her wrist beneath the bangles, by bruises, defiled.

  
Sometimes, I free fall into a lucid space.  
I see TVs flash a doll’s leg with a chick head  
And a cow barking with a bitch face.

A man called History chains the monsters under this bed,

And upon it I lie,

A creature tied,

To the altar to be sacrificed.

I see a manic girl screaming on the roadside,  
With all her luggage lying beside:  
"BOL NA!  
BOL NA!  
BOL NA!”  
Like the repetitive sound effects

In the horror movie's warning:  
"Don't let it in,   
don't let it in,   
don't let it in."  
Reverberating and echoing.

  
And when I wake up,  
I realize  
My dreams are not just dreams,  
I realize

I stand on the liminal space,

Where dreams and reality intermesh.

I realize

It doesn't really matter,

For they have always been one.
