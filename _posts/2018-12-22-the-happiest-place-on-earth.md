I like to place bricks on my voice,
<br>So it will let out only whispers,
<br>When my eyes are listening,
<br>To the moonlight falling asleep,
<br>On seabed.
 
I like to tie strings over my wrists,
<br>on my ankles so I would not jump,
<br>To catch stars playing freeze tag
<br>in my backyard.
 
It sounds like a nice place,
<br>A place snuggling in my imagination.
 
Dust will end its songs
<br>and become the audience today.
<br>Speakers will turn daft
<br>and instead birds will walk
<br>on our cements and sing, and roar.
<br>Leaves will turn green,
<br>Turn water,
<br>Turn a bliss,
<br>Lifting off the concretes,
<br>Sleeping on our clocks.
<br>And I will punch holes in my ears
<br>to hear
<br>Screams sleeping tonight.
 
It seems like a nice place,
<br>Where I want to breathe,
<br>A place which will not draw curtains,
<br>When I open my eyes.
 
Laughter will fly
<br>when stones tied to it
<br>will pull it down.
<br>Pages lost, will finally find
<br>their way back to dusty shelves.
<br>Somewhere I can swim,
<br>From each letter to each word.
<br>My fingers,
<br>My cheeks,
<br>My knees.
<br>I.
<br>I will swim and turn blue,
<br>Turn ink.
 
Is this a place?
<br>Find me this place;
<br>My eyes refuse to wake up to nothingness.
