The village is not the same.

The _jamun_ tree is motionless,

Dilapidated, covered with patches 

Of coarse, dry grass and anthills.

Lying over, crushing the distant memories

Of string _charpai_ and ludo-dice.

 

The roads have changed.

The gravel is coalescing 

Under the scalding sun,

With the shimmering coal tar,

Thrust over the muddy deathbed.

 

The pond is still there,

Devoid of water;

Stripped of algae and buffalo.

The playground besides is prostrate,

Robbed of the choric howzats.

Sifting through the ages,

Staring at me.

 

A new array of stars has unveiled itself.

The leaves rustle more emphatically;

The past echoes more than ever.

The clouds project monstrous silhouettes.

For the night was never more monotonous,

To be spent reflecting.

The sleep was never beckoned for.

 

The sun is bit harsher,

Mangoes a little less sweet.

Orange ice has made way for

Chocolate and vanilla cream.

Cold-drinks may be chilled,

But the gatherings are not that warm.

Afternoons no longer swish away,

Mornings no more come sprinting.
