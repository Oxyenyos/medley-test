Frieda, listen little love Frieda. 
<br>You have scars and burns and bumps-a, 
<br>And stretches and cracks that may look rueful, 
<br>But nothing little love, can make you beautiful, 
<br>Not in my eyes, not today, no no Frieda.
<br>Tomorrow, tomorrow is another day,
<br>Come to me then, when I'm old and grey, 
<br>Oh Frieda love, with your blemishes, 
<br>And scars and stitches and many bruises. 
<br>Till then, little love, do stay away, 
<br>I won't love you, no not today.
<br>Frieda, listen little love, Frieda, 
<br>Your face I've seen for far too long-a, 
<br>It has lost its charm; I hope you know, 
<br>That love is kind, love is great although 
<br>I loved you once, when you were new, 
<br>Now you are blue and I am through. 
<br>Oh my love Frieda, Ill sing for you, Frieda.
<br>Oh little Frieda. 
<br>Do be good, 
<br>Love you may, and love you should, 
<br>But Frieda, little love, do you remember, what I said? 
<br>Love, you are ugliest when you cry yourself to bed.
