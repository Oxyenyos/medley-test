hoshiarpur
<br>turns pink at sunset
<br>the setting sun casts a tint 
<br>on nameless faces,
<br>nameless roads,
<br>nameless graves.
<br>the setting sun sets fire
<br>to the fields
<br>the smoke, making its way to the other side,
<br>abandoned havelis
<br>house the bloodstains from partition,
<br>a broken memory
<br>weaved with pain, anger and loss.
<br>the smoke reaches the border
<br>crop dust mixed with blood and memory,
<br>greeting it's old inhabitants,
<br>carrying the comfort of home,
<br>and the loneliness of refuge.
<br>the barren fields of mehina
<br>sing for their return
<br>the flowers in jatpur and chabbewal
<br>demand to see the graves,
<br>the weeds recite Habib's poetry,
<br>cemeteries demand a homecoming.
<br>treasure chests house a pile of bones
<br>crop dust mixed with blood and memory.

hoshiarpur mourns punjab,
<br>hoshiarpur celebrates Durga,
<br>as a Sialkot mistress plays shatranj 
<br>outside the radio station
<br>while a rusting blade
<br>hangs from her waist,
<br>as the sun drowns in the arms of the universe
<br>and the stars comfort the moon.
