### Areeb Ahmad

Areeb Ahmad is currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in English Literature from Delhi University. Although he is an eclectic bookworm, he swears by all things SFF with Erikson as God and Malazan as Gospel. He is currently interning as an associate member for Feeding India, a non-profit organisation which primarily redistributes extra leftover food acquired through donations to the needy. Areeb has been writing since he was in sixth grade and would really like to finally finish working on a book of his own one of these days. He can be found desperately searching for book deals and rapidly accumulating his TBR pile.

## Sponsorship Heads

### Aaryaka Nidhi

Aaryaka Nidhi is a third year literature student at Hansraj College. In her writing, she paints cities within indistinct boundaries, spilling colours that mix and match, curling up in places that make them look like they belong there. Otherwise, she's generally busy spending time with and singing songs to her favourite dogs in college. She also believes that a can of Coke and a packet of blue Lays are the things that will eventually help us attain world peace.

### Rasseerat Kohli

An Economics major at the University of Delhi, Rasseerat Kohli knocks doors of fiction, poetry and narrative; somehow, finally making an excuse to embrace the playful child - personification. Acknowledging her knack for journalism, she went on to intern with The Indian Express Group and as she puts it "I updated the status of my mind, daily". Rasseerat was the recipient of Silver (worldwide) for Senior Category in The Queen's Commonwealth Essay Competition'16, organised in association with The Cambridge University Press. Looking forward to capitalising on public speaking while responding to her inner calling for fashion styling, this hard-to-pronounce name loves experimenting with diversity.

## Creative Heads

### Soumya Vats

Soumya Vats is a second year English Honours student at Hansraj College. An intern at Kiran Nadar Museum of Art and a former intern at SoDelhi, she is constantly chasing deadlines and metro trains. Her search for knowledge has taken her to summers at Brown University and University College London. She is currently trying her hand at slight extroversion and slam poetry and dreams of becoming a crime documentary maker some day. Till then, you can likely find her discussing conspiracy theories and dramatically narrating stories over chai in the canteen.

## Social Media Manager

### Sanghmitra Jethwani

Sanghmitra Jethwani is a third year literature student at Hansraj College. On most days, she tries to capture the tales recited by the streets of Delhi through her lens, trying to find stories and faces that have been buried for too long now, on others, she attempts to find the meaning of life in between the lines of Urdu poetry, and believes that one day she eventually will.
