    excerpt: 'Areeb Ahmad is currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in English Literature from Delhi University. Although he is an eclectic bookworm, he swears by all things SFF with Erikson as God and Malazan as Gospel. He is currently interning as an associate member for Feeding India, a non-profit organisation which primarily redistributes extra leftover food acquired through donations to the needy. Areeb has been writing since he was in sixth grade and would really like to finally finish working on a book of his own one of these days.

    excerpt: "Aaryaka Nidhi is a third year literature student at Hansraj College. In her writing, she paints cities within indistinct boundaries, spilling colours that mix and match, curling up in places that make them look like they belong there. Otherwise, she's generally busy spending time with and singing songs to her favourite dogs in college. She also believes that a can of Coke and a packet of blue Lays are the things that will eventually help us attain world peace."
