Hello!

Submissions for the Third Issue of The Medley, Ostraca’s bi-annual online literary journal, are now open and we wish to invite themed as well as non-themed entries for the sections of Fiction, Non-Fiction and Poetry, with any variety of style, structure, content and genre. Photo Essays are also welcome.

For this issue, we are looking for themed works on the topic of Local Flavour. The numerous places we inhabit have their own personal hallmarks, attributes which cannot be replicated anywhere else. Every moment is an interaction, every moment is a dialogue. These cityscapes, imagined and otherwise, surround and resound in us in manners big and small. Not only are we as individuals shaped by the little worlds that enclose us, whether it is our neighbourhoods, our streets, our cultures or our imagined spaces, but we in turn shape these worlds to mould our visions. In tandem with that multifarious awareness, we would love to look at works which negotiate individual as well as collective relationships with the geographical, cultural, political and social spaces that we occupy. We welcome creative expressions of such visions that give us insights into our urban and rural makeup, of how much of us is human and how much belongs to the world around us. Non-themed submissions will also be accepted. 

In general, we're looking for work from emerging writers and poets that has unbridled originality, a raw energy and doesn't shy away from coming into its own. We want poetry and prose that sings, fragments itself and takes flight. Give us your best, most daring, pieces, exploring new terrains and new metaphors, pieces that sketch out paths and avenues in an otherwise unknown wasteland. We're looking for diversity, for versatility and for new voices of representation from all over the globe.
 
 
PROSE: Only 1 piece at a time, 3000 words maximum.
