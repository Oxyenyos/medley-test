Submissions for the Second Issue of The Medley, Ostraca’s bi-annual online literary journal, are now open and we wish to invite entries for the sections of Fiction, Non-Fiction and Poetry, with any variety of style, theme and genre. Photo Essays are also welcome.

We're looking for work from emerging writers and poets that has unbridled originality, a raw energy and doesn't shy away from coming into its own. We want poetry and prose that sings, fragments itself and takes flight. Give us your best, most daring, pieces, exploring new terrains and new metaphors, pieces that sketch out paths and avenues in an otherwise unknown wasteland. We're looking for diversity, for versatility and for new voices of representation from all over the globe.

**PROSE:** Only 1 piece at a time, 2500 words maximum.<br>
**POETRY:** Up to 3 poems at a time, no length limits.<br>

1. Prose and poetry should be pasted in the body of the email. If your poems require special formatting, you may send an attachment. 

2. You also have to send a short third person bio, along with a headshot, in the submission email. 

3. Mention the category you are submitting for in the subject of your email. Before you send work, please familiarize yourself with The Medley and our editorial practices by going through our previous issues.

4. We allow only for previously unpublished works. Interested people can send send their entries to <a href= "mailto:submissions@themedley.in">submissions@themedley.in</a>. The deadline for submissions for this issue is 31st October. We are open to simultaneous submissions (so long as you classify them as such and immediately let us know if they’re accepted elsewhere).

5. Please submit no more than once per genre per reading period. Additional submissions will be ignored. If your work has been featured in The Medley, please wait at least a year from the date of your publication before submitting again.

6. The Medley requires First Serial Rights and all archival rights. All rights revert back to the author upon publication. If your work appears elsewhere in print or online, please give due credit to The Medley as the place where your work first appeared.
